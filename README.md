Overall, I'm new to all of this, so I would like to learn how to call TeraData queries through Python and save them to files for easy data cleaning process...or better to code it once in Pythong to clean up the data so I don't have to for monthly reports/visualization.

I also have an issue with my capstone where I'm running a large data set and I think it will run for a few days. I need a way to get the output saved and I think Pickle will do that for me.
